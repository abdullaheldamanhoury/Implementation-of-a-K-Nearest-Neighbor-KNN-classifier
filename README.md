This implementation is a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier that uses the leave-one-out cross validation approach for 
determining the best K value.This application is the classifier to the training data of the scanned images of the 10 digits (0 to 9)
provided in the file “ data.rar”. The rar file contains two folders: “Train” and “Test”. The “Train” folder contains 240 images
for each digit while the “Test” folder contains 20 images for each digit. The folder contains a filed named “Training Labels.txt” which
includes the labels of the 2400 images in order. 
The images in the “Train” folder should be used in the leave-one-out cross validation. Using maximum K of 100.
